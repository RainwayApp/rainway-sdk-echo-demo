# C# Console Demo

This example project shows how to build a simple echo server using the Rainway SDK in a .NET 5 console application. 

# Note

The 0.1.0 version of the rainway-sdk nuget package does not properly copy the `RainwayRuntime.dll` and `DesktopCapture.dll` to the output directory. To resolve this select the files in the solution explorer and change "Copy to Output" to "Always"
